// This records will be based on a sliding window divided in buckets
// of a T duration (example, 10 buckets of 1s each, will record the

// configured threshold in `ErrorPercentThresholdToOpen` setting
// and at least it made N executions configured in `MinimumRequestToOpen`

// executing. When the circuit has been in open state for a T duration
// configured in `WaitDurationInOpenState` will move to half open state.

// closed except that the measurements are different, in this case it
// will check that when N executions have been made (configured in
// `SuccessfulRequiredOnHalfOpen`) if all of them have been successfull,
// if all have been ok it will move to closed state, if not it will move
// to open state.
